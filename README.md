## Objectives
- The aim of our project to automate the application to overcome from the language barrier among countries and also states within the country.
- Also the Web application accepts text written and converts it into the language needed. 
- Application is able to recognize the text present in the image which stored in system or captured using camera .
- Translate the text into the language needed and display the translation result back on to the screen of system.
- The aim of the proposed system is to develop a system that has capability to perform Translation, Converting text to speech, Speech Recognition, Text Extraction. The system proposed here will be developed for a domain of English words.

## Text Translation:
- In Text translation we take text as input and convert it into another language. 
- The base language is English. 
- The text is split into words and then it is search in the dictionary and the corresponding matched text/word from the dictionary is displayed.
- English text can be translated into many official foreign and Indianlanguages

## Language Translation:- 
- Google translate API can be used to translate a text into other languages known to Google translator. 
- Googletrans is a free python library that implemented google translate API.
- It is an open source,free to use multilingual neural machine translation service developed by Google with each language having its own abbreviation.

 # Applications

- The main purpose of Language Translation by using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) with web portal is to bring down the Language barrier by enabling people to translate any text content from one language to another language, by simply taking a picture of the text they want to translate.
- The speed of translation is much higher than the human translation it takes more than an hour for translating 10,000 words for human whereas, few seconds are enough for the device to translation
- As the main intention of the project is to help people who travels around the globe and to help the blind by assisting them in reading text.
